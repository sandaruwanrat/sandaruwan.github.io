## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sandaruwanrat/sandaruwan.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### BIO

I am currently a Biology Master's student at Arkansas State University, interested in bioinformatics and machine learning applications in plant biology. The vast potential of computational analysis, when combined with natural sciences, always fascinated me. Hence, I joined Arkansas State University with the ambition to become a Data Scientist in bioinformatics. 



Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sandaruwanrat/sandaruwan.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
