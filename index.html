   <p>I am currently a Biology Master's student at Arkansas State University, interested in bioinformatics and machine learning applications in plant biology. The vast potential of computational analysis, when combined with natural sciences, always fascinated me. Hence, I joined Arkansas State University with the ambition to become a Data Scientist in bioinformatics. </p>
<p>Currently, I am working in the Wijerathna lab at Arkansas Biological Institute under Dr. Asela Wijerathene. Our Primary research focuses on building a predictive Gene Regulatory Network (GRN ) model using a machine learning-based approach to predict new transcription factor targets for soybeans. Since "Phytophthora sojae" is one of the highly destructive diseases around the world that causes huge crop loses in soybeans, we are expecting to find a machine learning-based approach to improve the resistance of the soybeans</p> 
    <p> Before my bioinformatics endeavor, I earned M.Sc. in Geophysics from the University of Memphis, where I obtained substantial experience in advanced computational data analysis using various tools such as python, MATLAB, UNIX. Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka, with a background in Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics. Apart from research work, I enjoy traveling, hiking, swimming, and playing cricket.<p>
